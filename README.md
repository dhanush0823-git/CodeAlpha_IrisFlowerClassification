# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification
I implemented the Iris Flower Classification project using Python and Scikit-learn. The model classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on sepal and petal measurements. The dataset was trained using Logistic Regression, achieving high accuracy, and the model can also predict results for manual inputs.
